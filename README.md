##ABOUT
MeetMoment is a cross-patform scheduling application for web and Android. 
(Android version repo can be found at: https://github.com/Chloe-SD/MeetMoment)
Both sides of the app share a common database, allowing you to access your meetings
from either platform. 

The Idea for MeetMoment was to use similar concepts to some existing scheduling apps, 
while having a more organized approach to tracking and maintaining meetings. 
Future updates will hopefully include advanced features such as automatically adding events
to your calendars, and ever auto-selecting your availability based on your calendar openings.
